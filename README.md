# Search GitHub User

## Search GitHub User is a GitHub searching app. Main propose is to get Information about GitHub user. Also, you can see the followers, repos, language used. It will show the Pie Chart, Donut Chart, Column Chart and Bar Chart.

## Search GitHub User I used ReactJS to build this app and Context API, Styled-Components, React Icons, React-Router-Dom, GitHub API, Fusion Charts And Auth0 API.

## I use Auth0 API and use .env file to hide it. If you want to use my apps please create your Auth0 account and from there you can get API. Create .env file or if you don't want to use .env file instead of ${process.env.REACT_APP_File_name} you can write API there. You can find in index.js.
## From Auth0 you can Sign In Google or GitHub Account or you can give your Email address. After you log in, you can search the GitHub User.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
